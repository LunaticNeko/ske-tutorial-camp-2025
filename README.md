# SKE Tutorial Camp 2025

Department of Computer Engineering, Kasetsart University

## Introduction

This code repository contains the code examples for sessions taught by
Chawanat Nakasan (Department of Computer Engineering) during the SKE
Tutorial Camp 2025.

## How to Use

It's optimal to learn to use `git` to automatically download the code
to your computer. However, without it, you can still click on each file
and either download it manually or just copy-paste the content.
